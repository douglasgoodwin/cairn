Text: <p><em>In Baron and Goodwin’s Lossless series the “materiality” of the digital becomes the source-code for experimental execution. The artists’ renditions of appropriated films are certainly not “lossless” (i.e. a copy of the original in which nothing is lost), but rather gainful: through various techniques of digital disruption–compression, file-sharing, the removal of essential digital information–the artists reveal the gain of a “new” media, full of material forms ripe for aesthetic sleuthing.</em></p><p><strong>Braxton Soderman</strong></p>
