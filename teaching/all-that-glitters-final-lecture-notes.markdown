Thanks for playing along with this experiment. I count it a success even though we only covered about a third of the material I hoped to cover. I want to go over some of the promised material before it’s over.

I regret that we never got to the homemade piezo-crystal contact microphone. It’s mostly easy: the hard part is getting your crystals to grow large enough to be useful. The musician Leafcutter John has an excellent article on growing your own crystals for work in sound. I was planning to show you his technique—check his website if you want to try it.

Let’s talk about a few things about light works. We’ll start with reflection, move on to refraction, discuss mirages. We’ll conclude with a bit about rainbows.

Let’s start with a question. Can you see light as it moves through space? You see the light emerge from this laser pointer and then again when it hits the wall. What’s going on between these two points? Now, imagine a larger system: light streaming from the sun. The daylight sky is full of light: light bouncing off clouds, light hanging on particulates, etc. But the night sky is dark. Space is dark. Why don’t you see the light when you look into the sky that you know is full of sunlight streaming by?

[Sidebar: there’s a nice essay on Air Light by Lawrence Weschler]

Let’s say I have another laser pointer and I cross the beams. Will we see that co-incidence? Will the rays interfere with one another? No.

This leads to a classic debate in the 17th century between our friend Newton the alchemist and Christian Huygens. Newton believed light a particle (the corpuscular theory), and Huygens believed light a wave (traveling through aether). Who was right? Yes, both. How can that be? What evidence can we see in our world?

Does anybody have a mirror? Ok, I’ll use this camera. Oh, or the silver apple on the back of my phone. Can I see the beam as it bounces off the mirror? Yes. Why? What are we seeing? I don’t know exactly, but it’s probably diffusion from something on the surface or possibly diffraction. Does diffraction even work with lasers? Not sure. But we can see an interaction between the surface of the metal and the lattice of the metal.

So we bounce this beam off the mirror. We can get closer or further, change the angle, etc. and it behaves this way. Is anybody surprised by this behavior? No, good.

OK, I poured a little bit of my protein drink into this water bottle so we can see the beam. Looks like I put too much in, but let’s see if I can show you. See, the angle of the beam changes with the angle of incidence. From above it’s negligible, and it becomes more pronounced as we increase the angle. What’s going on here?

The light seems to be moving more slowly in water. And then it emerges from the material at the same angle—and speed—as it entered. How does that work? And why does it seem to take a longer path. Would you expect that?

I hope to show you by the end that reflection and refraction are really the same thing. These media absorb the light and then re-emit it. The photons are absorbed exciting the material to the point of emitting another electron. Crazy game.

I want to talk about earthquakes for a minute—this will help you appreciate how weird waves are and that waves have properties that inform the weirdness of light. Who has been through an earthquake (all). Do you remember the 1989 quake in San Francisco? Why do you think that the Marina was destroyed while the rest of the city was mostly ok. It wasn’t because the quake was closer to the Marina, rather it has to do with the material those buildings were built on.

Waves travel differently in different media. A loose, less dense material will increase the amplitude of a transverse/shear wave. What does that look like?

Compare the laser beam traveling  through dense substrates such as water and glass.

This illustrates something called the Principle of Least Time. Most vectors travel as efficiently as possible through media. Generally that means that they will take the shortest path. But here we see the light path bending on its way, This does not seem efficient .What’s going on?

Let’s the example that Feynman gave to a room full of young men in 1962. There is a pretty girl in a boat yelling for help. You need to choose the quickest path to get to her. Given that you can run faster on land than you can swim in the water, how will you go? Straight of course. Or maybe you would sit on the bank and calculate it very carefully.

Now, let’s look at the mirage. I’m talking about the water that you think you see on the road on a sunny day. Is the water there? No. What are you seeing?

OK, imagine a mirror is on the same road. What would that look like? Water, because it’s reflecting the sky. Same with the mirage except that it’s not reflecting the sky exactly. It’s a refraction, and the light is moving in a weird curve. This is the path of least time. wtf? How does that work?
