One of the salient features of digital media is its apparent permanence. Because it is information and not material, the content goes undiminished by repeated playings. The RIAA would like to change that of course, because undiminished media means diminished sales. They advocate a licensing model whereby only the original owner (or device) would be able to perform this media.

But try this. What if the media were diminished by repeated plays? Let the underlying state of the host hardware were allowed to affect the media in a way which might be described as organic or systemic. In this way we build a bridge between the media and the host, to restore some material qualities to the content.

More projects ahead.
