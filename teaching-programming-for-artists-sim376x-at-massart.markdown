An in-depth introduction to computer programming for artistic applications, focused around the Max/MSP/Jitter programming language. Students will learn the fundamental skills required to develop their own software tools and interfaces for the manipulation and synthesis of audio and video, with a focus on applications in installation, composition, and performance. Other programming languages, such as SuperCollider, Stamp Basic, and C, will also be explored. This is a workshop in which artists will develop methods of expressing their thoughts and feelings about art and artistic concerns. It will include methods and techniques for describing, analyzing, and criticizing artworks in the context of the studio.
