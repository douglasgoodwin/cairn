<p>Introduction to Digital Media Production serves as an introduction to Web design, animated graphics, interactivity, and digital imaging. The emphasis in the course will be on the creation of meaningful works using the materials. While there will be some instruction in the technical aspects of new media, realize that concept, content, critique, and aesthetic decisions will be the major areas of concern.</p>

<p>Specific, elegant, and compelling concepts are the start of all great work, so the conceptual area will be given fundamental consideration. We will consider the conceptual basis of historical and contemporary work. Tools for the production of digital media are also charged with conceptual baggage, and we will identify this baggage wherever possible.</p>

<p>Aesthetics touch both conceptual and technical dimensions. We will engage in critiques on the aesthetics of past and present work in digital media.</p>

<p>The technical part of digital media production is constantly shifting: you will discard hundreds of software packages in your life. You will be best served by finding patterns in software and media that transcend obsolescence.</p>

<p>Tuesday classes will be discussions informed by presentations of and about the historical and formal dimensions of digital media. Thursdays will be production oriented with lectures on tools (hardware and software) , project management, and the technical peculiarities of digital media (compression, color spaces, reproducibility, and longevity).</p>

<h2 id="objectives">objective(s)</h2>

<p>You will enhance your knowledge of digital media in three general areas: conceptual, aesthetic, and technical.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">requirements</h2>

<p>Class attendance and participation are mandatory. You will each be expected to give two short presentations: one on the context and another on the practice of digital media. You will be actively developing a final project and articulating its context through weekly briefs. Your projects will advance through a series of stages from specification to prototype to published media. Final projects will be installed on the Emerson learning portal. Additionally weekly exercises will be given to keep you moving through the software.</p>

<h2 id="attendance-lateness">attendance, lateness</h2>

<p>Your final semester grade will be lowered by one point for each unexcused absence. More than 6 absences will cause you to fail automatically. Your final grade will be lowered by one-third of one point for each lateness to class. While that does not sound like much, every year I have at least one student whose grade dropped down to another letter lower. Be forewarned. Late projects: Your project and exercise grades will be lowered by 10% automatically if that project is submitted late.</p>
