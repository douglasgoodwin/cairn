This little fantasy shows a gamine fetching arrival information on her Nexus 4 smartphone. She runs down the stairs to catch a Redline train arriving at Metros Wilshire/Vermont station.

Its a fantasy on at least two levels. Metro doesnt have wireless connectivity in the stations (she just entered the station). But most importantly the app isn't finished yet! I am right in the middle of writing the application to push alerts to Google Transit. Give me a couple of weeks, ok?
