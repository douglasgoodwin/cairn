This is a prototype image showing a process Ive been developing over the past year. Prepare several short clips of video, cue them up, then tape some photographic paper to the monitor. Then darken the room and expose the paper to the video, allowing the light frmo the video to accumulate on the paper. Expose the paper and you should have an image not unlike rob gardners long-exposure pinhole images of paris.
