What does it have to do with biology?<\/strong><\/p><p>The Other Townsend is not a person. And yet, the Other can still operate as a human online and through data by gaining interests, moving around on a map, making posts on Facebook, and generating a heartbeat, mood, and sleeping pattern. You can even talk to the Other through texts. The \u201cpersonality\u201d we\u2019ve created to simulate life, however, is derived from the \u201cstolen\u201d information of five separate people. Companies can advertise to them, recognize their face, find their location, etc. and the information gathered was gathered manually in the same way Amazon, Google, Apple, and more gather constantly, proving the reductiveness of their methods of defining who qualifies as human, and the downfall of their unethical practices of data collection. Tech companies see you as a police sketch of you, or a \u201cdata portrait\u201d. To them you are not human\u2013you are points of information that can be bought and sold in order to advertise, track, or use. Even your biology is reduced to this, with services such as 23andme.com and Google\u2019s Verily spending nearly as much time in your genetics as you do. This constant and unchecked theft of data on behalf of tech companies is socially and politically unethical, exploitative, and reckless. By ignoring the human behind every point of data, they endanger us all.<\/p><p><\/p>"},"id":"4847b22a-07d4-4e48-afd2-f71aede30d2b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
